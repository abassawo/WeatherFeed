### Weather Feed

The Weather Feed application references similar architecture and design as [Photo Feed]("https://github.com/abassawo/photofeed")

Libraries used include Retrofit, Hilt, and Mockito. 

To build, provide a valid API key for OpenWeather's onecall API 3.0 (https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3)

There is also a LocalTestRepository available for mocking valid responses.

Unit tests can be found in the unit test package.
